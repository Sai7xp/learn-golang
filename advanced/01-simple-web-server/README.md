1. Spin up a http web server at a specific PORT using http package
2. Make a connection to TCP server from terminal and send raw GET request (HTTP is basically a TCP connection)
3. Create HTTP POST api and decode the request body as a Go Struct
4. Make a POST call to a URL using Go
5. Create an API which sends a music/audio file as response. Content-Type: audio
